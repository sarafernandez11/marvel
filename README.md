# MARVEL CHARACTER APP

This is a React web app that contains a list with information from all the Marvel characters, fetched from the official Marvel API.

### Github-hosted APP
If you're using Chrome or Firefox you can see the APP hosted [here](https://sarafernandez11.github.io/marvel/).

### To run it locally
You must have Node.js installed and up to date. Then, just download or clone this repo and, once inside the project directory run the following commands:

```
You should now type `localhost:3000` in your browser and you'll be able to see the site up and running!
